# Voice-to-Text

This repository contains code and resources for training a voice-to-text model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model leverages the Whisper architecture from OpenAI, designed for robust speech recognition tasks. The training process utilizes streaming datasets for efficient data handling and includes various optimization strategies to ensure fast and effective model training.

The goal is to develop an effective voice-to-text transcription model. The model is trained using the Common Voice dataset and the Whisper model architecture from OpenAI. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of the Hugging Face Transformers library, this project aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution for speech recognition tasks.
