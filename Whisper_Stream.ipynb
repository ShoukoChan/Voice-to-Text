    "Transformers have come up as a promising alternative, offering pre-trained parameters and fine-tuning capabilities. The Whisper model by OpenAI is trained on extensive multilingual data, has become a benchmark for ASR. This incorporation leverages the transformer's self-attention mechanism to process temporal sequences in audio data, providing extensive improvements over conventional models in terms of parallelizable training and handling long-term dependencies.\n",
